# Google Container with W&M Authentication Whitelist

This is a fork of [Google Container](https://github.com/mozilla/containers-everywhere/contain-google
) which is a fork of [Facebook Container](https://github.com/mozilla/contain-facebook)

This extension allows you to contain all Google domains in a Firefox Container, as well as authenticate your William and Mary student Google account. I have it on it on Github to make it easier to keep up with updates to the original Contain Google extension.

Best,
Jacob
